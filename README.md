Learning Clojure by writing a Clojure parser. In Clojure.

### Introduction ###

So you want to learn Clojure? Parse it. In Clojure. At least that's how we do things in [GeekSkool][].

GeekSkool is an intensive 3-month programme where programmers come to improve their skills. The preferred way that [Santosh Rajan][], the founder of GeekSkool, likes to do this is by throwing seemingly daunting challenges at the unsuspecting student.

So we're going to learn Clojure by 'parsing' Clojure, using Clojure. But what exactly do we mean by 'parsing'? 

In this project, parsing means converting valid Clojure code into something called an *Abstract Syntax Tree*, or AST for short.
